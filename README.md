# Battlecode 2026 Lecture Player

This is the repo containing code written during the Battlecode 2026 lectures. It is exactly the same as the [Battlecode 2026 scaffold](https://github.com/battlecode/battlecode26-scaffold) with the addition of the example bots `lectureplayer` and `lectureplayer_py` in the `src` directory.
